/**
 * The DeepSeek platform balance behind the Context Dashboard's header
 * capsule: the figure the previous open remembered (memory first, then
 * storage) shown at once, plus one background read of the plugin's
 * `/api/dsh-context/balance` fetch route (host/balance.ts) on every open, so
 * the remembered total never survives a stale one for long.
 *
 * A remembered figure is a stale-while-revalidate display choice, not an
 * error state: the platform's balance moves far slower than the dashboard
 * opens, and a stale figure that a background read corrects beats a blank
 * pill on every visit. An open that finds nothing remembered — and a route
 * that answers nothing while nothing is remembered — resolves `null`, and
 * the capsule renders nothing: a balance viewer shows a real number or it
 * shows nothing at all, never a spinner or an error where a pill should be.
